  This is my blog, where I have written over 175 articles on a variety of topics, most of which are
  about one of two major themes. The first is computer science, which is my area of speciality as a
  Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. The second can be broadly categorized as "deafness," which relates
  to my experience and knowledge of being deaf.
