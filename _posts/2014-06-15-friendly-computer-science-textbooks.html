<p>I'd been meaning to post this earlier, but I got sidetracked by <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about">Project Euler</a> (more on that later). In any case, I want to list a few computer science textbooks that, in my opinion, are written in a friendly style and are easy for someone to read like a novel. These are my favorite kind of textbooks, because they often incorporate two important aspects: <em>elaboration</em> and <em>examples</em>. Notice that this does <em>not</em> mean that mastering the corresponding subject is easy! It just makes it <em>easier</em> for an experienced and educated reader to do so.</p>
<p>I'm inspired to think about this because, as much as I enjoyed my complex analysis class last fall, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complex-Analysis-Princeton-Lectures-No/dp/0691113858">textbook</a> we used glosses over so many details that it made analyzing some of the proofs excruciatingly difficult. At least, for me ... I can't speak for everyone in the class, but my professor did have to explain that the goal of his lectures was to emphasize <em>why</em> the authors/book did something in their proofs.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, I read parts of <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719239">Methods of Mathematical Economics</a>, a textbook about the mathematics behind linear programming and other popular applied mathematics techniques. It is written in a conversational style (the author uses "I" instead of "we"), and it was very helpful to me for a final project.</p>
<p>Here are four books on the computer science side that I've found to be very readable.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.aw-bc.com/info/kleinberg/">Algorithm Design</a>, by <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/">Jon Kleinberg</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/eva/eva.html">Eva Tardos</a>, presents an introduction to the common themes underlying an algorithms course. I enjoyed it because it emphasizes the decision-making behind many of the proofs. In addition, it contains several sample problems with detailed solutions. These solutions also explain why certain approaches might not work or are suboptimal.</li>
<li><a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a>, by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/">Stuart Russell</a> and <a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>, is a surprisingly readable "encyclopedia-like" book about AI. I do <em>not </em>recommend reading the entire thing, especially in one sitting! But if you pick out a single chapter, the book should serve you well. I talked with Stuart when I was visiting Berkeley, and he told me I needed to know more learning theory. I asked him how I could learn more, and he said: "read the book." Good -- I'll do that!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/academic/product/0,3110,0132392275,00.html">Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms</a>, by <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Andrew S. Tanenbaum</a> and <a href="http://www.distributed-systems.net/">Maarten Van Steen</a>, is about concepts of distributed systems (i.e., those relying on multiple computers/machines). This book is <em>filled</em> with examples. Almost every concept is explained with an immediate real-life example.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a>, by <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~sipser/">Michael Sipser</a>, overlaps somewhat with <i>Algorithm Design</i>, but emphasizes automata, computability, and complexity, rather than pure algorithms. It is a concise book, but somehow provides the impression that it's detailed and expansive. Fortunately, each chapter contains problems with full solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd be interested in knowing if there are other popular, readable computer science textbooks.</p>
