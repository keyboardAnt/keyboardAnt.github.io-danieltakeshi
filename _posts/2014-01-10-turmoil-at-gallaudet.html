<p>This is relatively old news, but I thought it would be interesting to bring this up so I could discuss my perspective.</p>
<p>I think many people are aware that Gallaudet University is a university for deaf students. A side effect of this is that there is a strong deaf culture prevalent in the school. For instance, American Sign Language is expected to be the norm, and students who don't use it are often unwelcome.</p>
<p>This was evident in the turmoil Gallaudet experienced in 2006 upon the selection of Dr. Jane Fernandes as the new university president. She was supposed to replace departing president I. King Jordan, who was appointed president in 1988</p>
<p>The center of the controversy was her opinion that Gallaudet must embrace "all kinds of deaf people" and the many ways they communicate. Though she saw American Sign Language as always being central to Gallaudet, she said she would like to see the institution become more inclusive of people who might not have grown up using sign language.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">In October 2006, the New York Times published “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/education/21gallaudet.html?pagewanted=all">Turmoil at College for Deaf Reflects Broader Debate</a>,” which concerned the actions of deaf students toward the appointment of a new president in Gallaudet University, America’s only deaf liberal arts college. The article’s broader meaning offered a reflection of what it really means to be deaf nowadays.</span></p>
<p>What caused the turmoil was that Jane Fernandes, who was selected as Gallaudet’s president, was seemingly out of touch with the deaf culture there. Among the factors that discouraged students to support her appointment was that she was married to a hearing person, she learned American Sign Language at the relatively late age of 23 (compared to most of the Gallaudet students), and she allowed professors who were not completely fluent in signing to continue teaching, possibly putting some students at a disadvantage. She has also sparked controversy by suggesting that Gallaudet’s future lay in welcome deaf people of different levels of hearing and communication methods, not just promoting American Sign Language and prohibiting spoken language.</p>
<p>This article was interesting to me as I wondered if I would fit in Gallaudet had I been a student there. I have used spoken language more than American Sign Language for most of my life because I interact far more with hearing people than deaf people. I think that, while Gallaudet students have good intentions with trying to keep sign language predominant, they are missing the idea that the vast majority of the world is “hearing”. While the importance of maintaining sign language is so important for the deaf education, there is also the need to face reality.</p>
<p>That is not to say that I think the appointment of Dr. Fernandes should not go without question. Her allowance of professors who are shaky with signing does not seem to be a good idea, as I know firsthand how difficult it can be for sign language interpreters to easily convey information in a technical class, such as advanced mathematics. If what is said about her questionable leadership is true, then that is another deterring factor for her election.</p>
<p>But my original thought of the students overreacting still stands. By protesting the appointment, they cause Gallaudet to go in turmoil and possibly embarrass them on national news. Their apparent desire to shun spoken language was the biggest factor in why I never considered Gallaudet for my future.</p>
