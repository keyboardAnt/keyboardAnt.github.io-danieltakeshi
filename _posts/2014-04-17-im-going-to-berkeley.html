<p>This entry is a few days overdue --- my apologies. (Excuse of the day: my thesis is due in a few weeks.) Admitted students had until April 15th to make their graduate school choices, and I made mine on April 13. As you can no doubt tell from the title of this post, I have committed to the University of California, Berkeley. I will start pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science there this fall.</p>
<p>It was not an easy decision, especially because I only applied to top-tier schools. I was debating for a <em>full month</em> between Berkeley and Washington (with each school seemingly have the edge on various days), but in the end, there were several factors that made me end up on Berkeley.</p>
<p>It's an exciting time for me! I have already received an email about setting up my Berkeley ID, and I can't wait to get started this fall. I hope that the next six years (five if I'm extraordinarily lucky) will bring fulfilling and rewarding experiences.</p>
