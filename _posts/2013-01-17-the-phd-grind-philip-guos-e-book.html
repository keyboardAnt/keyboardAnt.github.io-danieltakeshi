<p>Today, I read Philip Guo's e-book <em><a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">The Ph.D. Grind</a>. </em>It's completely free (just visit the link and download) and it's fairly easy reading, so one should be able to finish in about an hour or two. After reading it, I was both enlightened and impressed. The book seemed to accomplish its goals: provide a clear -- but not overly detailed -- account of a computer science graduate student's journey to obtain a Ph.D. (Philip Guo was a Ph.D. student at Stanford University.) One of the reasons why I like it is that the author included many examples of how he struggled during his first three years of his Ph.D. program, and more importantly, <i>why </i>those struggles occurred. By the end of the book, I was pondering to myself: <em>can I avoid the pitfalls he encountered, and intelligently grind away at a publishable</em> <em>project</em>? As you can tell, some amount of "grinding" is necessary; otherwise, you'll never make any progress. But if you go entirely on the wrong track -- that is, if you're working hours and hours by yourself on a famous professor's project without any direction -- that's not a good idea.</p>
<p>Possibly more than anything else, <em>The Ph.D. Grind </em>taught me the value of (at least initially)working with <em>assistant professors </em>and <em>postdoctoral researchers.</em> The reason is quite simple.</p>
<p><em>They are the ones under the most pressure to publish.</em></p>
<p><em></em>The assistant professor needs to publish for tenure; the postdoc needs to publish to <em>get </em>an assistant professorship. Now, that's <em>not</em> to say a Ph.D. student should <em>never</em> pick a tenured professor to be an advisor ... it's just that the student might want to be part of a research group that's composed of at least one non-tenured faculty.</p>
<p>Some of my quick thoughts after reading this book include:</p>
<ol>
<li>I absolutely, positively want to get a graduate fellowship.</li>
<li>I should talk with all assistant professors at whatever university I'm at (for graduate school) and offer my services.</li>
<li>I cannot, unless circumstances are extremely unexceptional, work all day on a project</li>
<li>Aim for top-tier conference publications earlier; it makes the process of actually writing the thesis a formality.</li>
</ol>
<p>To wrap things up, I recommend <em>The Ph.D. Grind </em>especially to undergraduates who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science. Again, it's free and easy to read.</p>
