<p>This was a nice article that explains how some of the games I played as a youth were NP-hard. I suppose that makes me feel better that I was such a great player. I've read part of this and will read it completely after my finals.</p>

<p>EDIT (July 2013): So it took a little longer than I thought for me to finish reading. I was fairly impressed with these results, though I can understand if some "serious" scientists might not think highly of these. Professor <a href="http://erikdemaine.org/">Erik Demaine</a> lists this article as a <em>manuscript</em><em>, </em>so it looks like it hasn't been accepted into a prestigious conference.</p>
<p>The paper itself is easy reading, and you don't have to be an expert in theory to understand the big idea. The techniques mostly rely on reducing the game to a set of really simple rules.</p>
