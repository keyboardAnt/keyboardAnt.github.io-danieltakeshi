<p>"Through Deaf Eyes" was a remarkable movie that seemed to accurately depict life for deaf people and their history. As I watched the movie, it reminded me of many things I experienced and felt during my childhood and what I have observed as a deaf person. I could relate with a large part of what the video said, such as the challenges hearing parents (as well as the child) face when they give birth to a deaf child. The film even taught me some new things, which was expected since I certainly do not know everything about deafness and its history.</p>
<p>One of the things that struck me about the movie was how often American Sign Language was featured. There are many deaf people that do not sign, as the movie indicated, but the vast majority of the people that add commentary to the film use sign. I believe this was the right decision by the film if statistics show that deaf children with early knowledge of American Sign Language have better reading levels than their non-signing deaf classmates. Furthermore, the use of sign language may have been used to dispel Alexander Graham Bell’s idea that oral language for deaf students should be preferred over sign language.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the movie that intrigued me was how deafness was viewed as a minority group, such as African Americans. This was particularly emphasized when Gallaudet’s students advocated for a deaf president, like how historically black colleges would have black presidents. For much of my life, I never viewed myself as part of a minority since I thought of myself as a half white, half Asian person first. However, once I became a senior in high school and wrote my college essays (which were centered around deafness), I began to view myself more as a member of a minority group. I suppose my reluctance in thinking this way at first was because of how I wanted to be more integrated in the hearing community. As I grew older, however, I realized that I was probably better off being firmly established in both the deaf and hearing worlds.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a third point in the film that caught my eye. That was when Marlee Matlin was criticized for speaking the names of people while she was on television to present the 1988 Best Actor award, rather than signing. I understand the merits of supporting sign language, but again this strikes me as trivial since deaf people should have the right to decide whether they choose to speak or sign. In fact, had I been on television that day, I would have spoken as well.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a great film for me to watch, and I would recommend it to any person, deaf or hearing, who would like to learn more about what life is like through deaf eyes.</p>
