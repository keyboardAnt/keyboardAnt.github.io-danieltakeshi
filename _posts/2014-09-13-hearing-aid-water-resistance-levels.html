<p>&lt;talk about how this has been a recurrent theme&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;give a bit of an intro explain water levels</p>
<p>&lt;one advantage of Berkeley ... hardly ever any rain! so people here don't need to worry about that It's been one month here and I don't think I've ever seen any rain here at all! So I don't understand how people can complain about the weather. For all its greatness, Honololu, HI, gets a ridiculous amount of rain.</p>
