<p>My birthday's on August 10. I was born on August 10, 1992. It's not August 10th yet, at least in my current timezone, but I was born in a different timezone that's 3 hours later. So I still consider myself 19. Only two more years until I can drink legally!</p>
<p>This got me wondering. If someone is born in L.A. and immediately moves to New York city to live, is that person automatically 3 more hours older, excluding the transportation time?</p>
<p>EDIT June 24, 2013: I can't believe it's taken me this long to realize that I originally mistyped the title of this post. It used to be "So, I turned 19," without the capitalized "t" ...</p>
