<p>I have been a teaching assistant (TA) at Williams College for the past four semesters, and will likely continue TA duties during my entire senior year, for a full six semesters of TA experience. (May update: I will be the theory of computation TA during the fall 2013 semester.) I therefore believe I can offer a reasonable explanation for what a TA does at a primarily undergraduate institution, especially if one is working in STEM fields.</p>
<p>First, a TA's primary duty will be grading problem sets. The questions will range from straightforward computation to proof-oriented to programming. Grade them according to whatever scale or rigor the professor desires.</p>
<p>A second common duty will be to actually help students. These take the form of office hours ("TA Sessions"), but can also involve some lab supervision. In my opinion, this is a much more pleasant aspect of being a TA. Ideally, one will act like a professor and provide guidance to the student. It is crucial, though, not to give away big ideas or answers, though I understand if some students may want to check their results for some computation-heavy questions.</p>
<p>I do not believe it is standard for a TA to be grading exams, because those tend to be worth a much larger percentage of a course grade and there can be more peer pressure that could adversely affect one's judgement. Furthermore, in undergraduate institutions, the professor has to do some grading, right?</p>
<p>For me, being deaf so far has not seemed to hinder my TA performance. TA sessions are rarely crowded, so it's easy to get some one-on-one interaction with students. When it does get crowded, I tell everyone to calm down.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I would give three tips on how to be a good TA from the perspective of a person who has been on both ends of the student-TA interaction:</p>
<p>1. Don't give away answers to complicated proofs right away. If a student doesn't know where to start, offer initial guidance. If a student's almost done, look and point out the weaknesses. Do <em>not</em> tell students to ask classmates for answers. (Incredibly, I had a TA tell me that before!)</p>
<p>2. If there are complicated problems that are hard to grasp, review them (and any solutions, if possible) before the TA sessions.</p>
<p>3. Do not read right from the solutions manual during TA sessions unless absolutely necessary. It makes students believe that TA sessions are a pure question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>And here are three extra tips for the aspiring TA who wants to maximize his or her experience:</p>
<p>1. Aim to TA courses where a high proportion of students type their homework, preferably in LaTeX. I've had enough trouble reading bad handwriting these past few years.</p>
<p>2. Aim to TA courses where at least two hours (but not much more than that) of TA sessions are required.</p>
<p>3. Aim to TA the upper-level courses, where students tend to be more serious about their subject. As a side note, they may be less likely to ask "What's the answer?" and similar dumb questions.</p>
