<p>[Save until December 2015 or even a few days later]</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2015/01/08/new-years-resolutions-2015-edition/">I set a goal to read more books</a>. The results are in: I read XX books in 2015, not including <em>really </em>short books (say 100 pages is the minimum), academic papers, textbooks, and news/blog/journal articles.</p>
<p>Here is the full list of books I've read for this year, with a quick summary for each and the completion date. My favorite books are in <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Longitude (January 5). A book I enjoyed because of the sheer tenacity it must have taken for John Harrison to focus on one thing in his life.</li>
<li>The Maze Runner (January 5). A high-octane thriller that, like Battle Royale, kept me engrossed into the book the whole time. I haven't seen the movie, but maybe later I will.</li>
<li>In progress...</li>
</ol>
