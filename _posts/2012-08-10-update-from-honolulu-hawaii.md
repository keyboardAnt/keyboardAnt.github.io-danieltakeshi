As I mentioned earlier, I&#8217;m in Honolulu, Hawaii. I&#8217;ve been taking many pictures, which gives me the chance to *finally* add a picturesque post to my text-based blog. And since I just turned 20, I can continue to post on my birthday, just as I [did last year][1].

One of the highlights of my trip was visiting Kauai, the fourth Hawaiian island I&#8217;ve set foot on. I took a picture of the same falls that was on the cover page of the tour guide. It&#8217;s gorgeous.

Here&#8217;s a view of Waimea Canyon, or the [Grand Canyon of the Pacific][2]. I&#8217;ve never been to the real Grand Canyon, but it felt like I was looking at a similar structure of nature. The view was so nice that I decided to add a panorama of this to replace the ugly default image of this WordPress Blog template.

Back in Oahu, I was at Waimea *Bay*. (What&#8217;s up with the repeated name?) This is one of the most beautiful beaches I&#8217;ve set foot on. I&#8217;m glad this is the summer &#8212; I&#8217;ve heard that real waves appear in the winter.

<a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/update-from-honolulu-hawaii/2012-08-09-13-06-46/" rel="attachment wp-att-512"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-512" title="2012-08-09 13.06.46" alt="" src="http://seitad.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2012-08-09-13-06-46.jpg?w=460" width="460" height="345" /></a>

There were also some nice Japanese-style temples on the way back from Waimea.

Afterwards, I made my way to the famous Nuuanu Pali Lookout, whose strong winds are (sadly) the only thing that can make my hair stick up. Looking at this reminded me that I should have increased the resolution of my images on my phone.

Finally, I&#8217;ve also had my share of mischievous moments.

<a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/update-from-honolulu-hawaii/photo/" rel="attachment wp-att-499"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-499" title="photo" alt="" src="http://seitad.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/photo1.jpg?w=460" width="460" height="613" /></a>

All right, that&#8217;s enough for now. It&#8217;s back to more traditional blog entries later. I have a lot I want to talk about in the next month.
