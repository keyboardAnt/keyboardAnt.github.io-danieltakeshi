<p>This article is called “Men are Pigs” and is about how men are seemingly less willing to learn American Sign Language as compared to women. In addition, it discusses the difficulties with convincing hearing children to learn sign language, but that can be countered by presenting the class in an interesting way. But for a adult husband or a boyfriend, it can be tough for his female partner to convince him to join a sign language class.</p>
<p>From my life experiences, I have not seen this phenomenon. This author of the article even mentions that his suggestion is subjective and not scientifically proven. Contrastingly, I have been able to teach both men and women sign language equally well. Moreover, people of both gender seemed to have been equally interested in learning sign language. As an example, the sign language class at Williams College’s winter study program seems to have an even gender ratio. Also, my parents have both been equally willing to learn sign language. My mother is slightly better than my father, but that has more to do with how she learned the language at a younger age.</p>
<p>I do not, however, want to detract from this article. The author mentions how “macho”-type men can sometimes be more reserved about their emotions and communication. The nature of American Sign Language requires emotion and expression, and a good signer will not sign with a blank face. By looking at someone’s facial expression while he signs, I can tell if he is experienced or a beginner. In this respect, I can agree with the article’s stance on reserved expression in that almost everyone who learns sign language starts out with a stone cold face.</p>
<p>Still, there is something disquieting about what the author thinks about hearing men. It makes me wonder about the implications of this idea – if it is true – on deaf people and the Deaf world. Will future generations of hearing men shy away from sign language despite the rising prominence of deaf people in society? As a deaf person, I hope this does not happen.</p>
