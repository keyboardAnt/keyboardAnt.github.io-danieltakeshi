<p>I'm about to enter my senior year at Williams College, and my goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science directly after graduation. Thus, I have to write some graduate school applications.</p>
<p>Since this seems to be a topic that interests many college students across the country, I thought it would be interesting to show readers how I progress through this crucial stage of my life. Perhaps this will be informative to the random student who happens to come across this blog.</p>
<p>Also, since I haven't actually <em>started </em>the applications, it makes sense to write now so that it's ultra-clear what I was thinking, planning, etc. Hence, this post is called "Stage 1."</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now, in computer science, <em>zero is the new one</em>, so we tend to start numbering from zero. But it doesn't make sense to do that for this blog entry. In my opinion, "Stage 0" consists of everything one does before the application season: doing well in <em>computer science</em> courses, getting solid research experience, reading about and <em>understanding</em> graduate school life, GREs, etc. Obviously, anyone who hasn't done most of these and wants to pursue a C.S. Ph.D. now is pretty much screwed.</p>
<p>For me, though, I'm almost through with Stage 0. I think I've done fairly well at Williams so far, and I have some research experience. I've also read some writings that I found <i>extremely helpful</i> to me; two of the best are Professor Philip Guo's <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">PhD Grind</a>, and Professor Mor Harchol-Balter's <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf">PhD advice</a>. Finally, I took the general GRE back in April, so I'm good to go with that. I have <em>not </em>taken the subject test, though ... and I'll probably take it anyway, even if some schools don't require it (more on that later).</p>
<p>Thus, I'll define Stage 1 (i.e. right now) as the process of determining where to apply and setting a schedule for completing the application materials.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I hope to attend a well regarded computer science department. Sure, I can take the C.S. <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings">rankings</a> straight off of the U.S. News &amp; World Report, but I need to be careful not to pick a school because of its overall prestige, only to realize that it's not as strong in my projected research areas as it is in other fields. (Even worse is a school that has great <em>overall </em>prestige, but has a virtually nonexistent computer science department.)</p>
<p>Context matters. As an example, I once knew a guy who turned down an offer from a top four school to go to one that was ranked well outside the top ten. I thought he was crazy --- until I realized that the school he went to was extremely strong in his research area.</p>
<p>So what are the benefits of attending a prestigious graduate school institution other than the prestige? Professor <a href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/">Jeff Erickson</a> suggests that <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/90/university-rank-stature-how-much-does-it-affect-ones-career-post-ph-d/154#154">one reason</a> is the average quality of the graduate students. It makes sense that the better the graduate students, the more they can help and motivate each other to advance the field of computer science. (Of course, it also helps if they're not enormously cut-throat!) The professors at the top school will also be leaders in their field, but I need to be careful again here because a famous professor does not imply an excellent advisor. Is it possible to gain knowledge on an advisor's effectiveness by investigating the career paths of his or her Ph.D. students?</p>
<p>The strength of the department is clearly going to be my primary factor in graduate school. But there are a few other factors to consider. One is the location; I'm probably going to be happy in a place that's not too rural nor right in the middle of a city. If I had to choose one of the extremes, I'd opt for the urban environment, and one of the reasons is that in a larger city, it's probably easier for me to secure accommodations. <em>In fact, I'd suggest this is true for anyone with a documented disability.</em> A city also makes it easier to have direct fights instead of time-consuming stoppages, and would give me a break of mountains and forests after spending four years in Williamstown.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's enough wishful thinking and non-application stuff. Right now I really need to obey the following schedule:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish first drafts of applications by the end of August</li>
<li>Study for the computer science subject test from the period of mid-August to mid-October, and take the exam sometime then or shortly after</li>
<li>Secure letters of recommendation by the start of September, and give the recommenders all the relevant information about me by some scheduled date</li>
<li>Finish second drafts of applications by the end of September</li>
</ol>
<p>I figure it can't hurt to at least take the computer science GRE subject test. If a school requires it, then I'll have done it. If not, then I can still see what areas I need to study in further detail.</p>
