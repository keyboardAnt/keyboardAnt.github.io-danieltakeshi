<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>Well, I guess that's good enough for an introduction. No, wait, this isn't a world of computer science, so I guess it's not good enough. (Computer science people will understand the joke.) Actually, I have to retract the last statement -- isn't it already a world of computers? Anyway, I'm an eighteen year old male living in the United States. I'm a student at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and my hometown is Guilderland, New York. I have also been deaf since birth.</p>
<p>I have two primary objectives in mind about this blog. The first is that I want to spread my knowledge of deafness and deaf culture to my readers. The second is that I also want to talk about what life is like as a college student, as well as in academia. I hope to land a job in academia within the next decade. By doing so, I'll be one of the few deaf people I know who have an academic job. I know that there are numerous deaf professors at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at RIT - maybe even fifty or so - but elsewhere, professors are scarce. It is my lifelong aim to rectify that.</p>
<p>And, naturally, there will also be some random posts about things just popping up in my head, or just random things because I want to write something down for the sake of writing something down. Or perhaps they'll be something so important that I just can't ignore them. What about the House just passing a deal to avoid a debt crisis on August 2nd? (Oh wait, that's a random thought!) I'll just include those in an "everything else" category. But hopefully, I'll be able to focus mostly on academia and deafness.</p>
<p>More details about my aspirations, expectations, and interests will come in future posts when I get used to the WordPress platform.</p>
<p>I look forward to having a long, lasting blog!</p>
