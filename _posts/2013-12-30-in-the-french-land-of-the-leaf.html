<p>Until I watched <i>In the Land of the Deaf,</i> I had only seen sign language in the American version. As a result, when I watched the first 20 minutes of the video, I was not sure what the people were signing, as the signs were not familiar to me. It was only at the point where one of the men most frequently featured in the film mentioned that signs are not universal. He would sign: “In French, we have this; America, it’s this; Germany, it’s different.” I then realized that I was watching French Sign Language, and so I watched intently, trying to discern some of the differences between American and French Sign Languages. That, along with my thoughts on speech training, was what caught my eye the most while I watched the film.</p>
<p>The easiest sign for me to notice in French Sign Language was “sign” itself. In American Sign Language, we use two index fingers and “roll them back” to indicate the word “sign.” In French, apparently, a full palm is used instead, and the motion is opposite. The palms are rotated forward, then down, then back, then up, and then forward again, the opposite of the motion in American Sign Language. I was also quite interested in the scene where a woman was asking a young boy the sign for mother, father, and other words. I noticed that masculine words were signed higher than the feminine words. Even though it was tough for me to tell the similarities between American and French Sign Language, the previous scene helped me realize that the former language was based on the latter.</p>
<p>While signing was a major aspect of <i>In the Land of the Deaf, </i>scenes of speech training were incorporated in the film. It brought back memories of when I was in elementary – and even middle – school and underwent somewhat rigorous speech training. I think the film did a good job showing the right scenes of speech and the relevant segments of training, such as practicing the “ssssss” sound and throat movement. I felt the film went a bit overboard on these scenes, though, and they would be better off replacing those with the challenges and life stories of deaf people. I would have been more interested in knowing the rest of the first man’s life story, when he wanted to be an actor but was not allowed to be one.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a decent film. I would be interested in knowing more about French Sign Language and its impact on American Sign Language today.</p>
