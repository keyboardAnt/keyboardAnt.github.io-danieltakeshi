<p>So I spent much of the summer of 2011 at the University of Washington at Seattle as part of the Summer Academy for Advancing Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing in Computing. (Will they ever change that name so it isn't a mouthful???) It's a 9-week residential program that brings 13 deaf and hard-of-hearing students together who take courses and attend talks together. I was one of those students, along with my brother. When I first heard about the program, I had mixed feelings. I didn't consider myself as a computer science person, and I felt like this program wouldn't match my interests. But what was once a near last-choice summer experience may have unintentionally, yet incredibly, led me to gravitate towards computer science as a major.</p>
<p>You can read the description of the program <a href="http://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/dhh/academy/">on the web</a> (alternatively, just Google search Summer Academy Deaf and Hard of Hearing) so I won't explain everything. However, it wasn't like being at Williams, since there were only 2 classes there compared with 4 at my college. What this program offered that I hadn't experienced before was the opportunity to see what current computer science graduate students and workers were doing. Graduate students presented their topics, ranging from Android programs to touch-screens for blind people, while people in industry talked about their experience and jobs, which typically involved software engineering or information technology.</p>
<p>We'll see how this program impacts me in the future. Check back in five years.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm going to read more about the ultra-popular computer game -- not just at the Summer Academy but global -- <em>Minecraft</em> and it's upcoming 1.8 version. I can't wait....</p>
