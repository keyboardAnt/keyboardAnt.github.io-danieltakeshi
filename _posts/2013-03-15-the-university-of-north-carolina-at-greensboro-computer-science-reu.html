<p>This summer, I am going to participate in the <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/cmp/reu/">University of North Carolina at Greensboro algorithmic combinatorics on words REU</a>. The research there pertains to algorithms and theory of computation, so I'm diverging from machine learning (at least for a short while). This will be my second REU experience, and I hope to make the most of my eight weeks there. Now, the task is to contact their administrators -- starting today -- so that I can set up my accommodation services (sign language interpreters). I don't know of a way to do this other than to just keep emailing them about suggestions, so that's what I'll be doing.</p>
<p>I haven't done a whole lot of writing this past month, and it's going to be even more difficult with the general GREs coming up in less than a week. But I'll probably do more writing after that.</p>
