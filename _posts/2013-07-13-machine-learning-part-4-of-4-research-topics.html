<p><em>This is the final post in a four-part series about machine learning. You can find the complete series in theÂ <a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/detailed-directory-of-blog-entries/">archives</a>.</em></p>
<p>In the first three posts of this series, I gave a high-level description of what would encompass an entire machine learning course.</p>
<p>But this post will be about research topics. It makes sense for me to talk about this, given that my senior thesis is in machine learning. I'll discuss where I get the work, some famous professors, and then some of the interesting papers I've read.</p>
<p>I will be getting most of my sources from the International Conference in Machine Learning. As a side note, here are some of the most well known venues for distributing machine learning work:</p>
<ol>
<li>ICML</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are some of the famous professors in the field.</p>
<ol>
<li>Michael I. Jordan (He needs the "I", since it's hard having the same name as Michael Jordan)</li>
<li>Tom Mitchell</li>
<li>Andrew Ng</li>
<li>Vladmir Vapnik</li>
</ol>
<p>Jordan is known for ... blah blah blah, and Vapnik is known for designing the original support vector machine.</p>
<p>Now, here are some of the papers I've really liked.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 1:</strong></p>
<p>Paper 1 is about</p>
<p><strong>Paper 2:</strong></p>
<p>This is about ...</p>
<p><strong>Paper 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This is about ...</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>That wraps up the machine learning series of posts. As you can see, there's a lot in store for the future. I'm looking forward to making my own contributions.</p>
