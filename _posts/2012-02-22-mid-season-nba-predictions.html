<p>Well, we’re about halfway done with the season, so I think it’s fair to start thinking about end-of-season awards and playoff predictions. Nothing is set in stone, though, and the lockout has caused this league to be a bit less “fundamental” than in years past, as exemplified by a drop in field goal percentage and the prevalence of tiring back-to-back-to-back games.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are my mid-season All-NBA team predictions.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First team All-NBA<br />
G: Derrick Rose<br />
G: Kobe Bryant<br />
F: Kevin Durant<br />
F: LeBron James<br />
C: Dwight Howard</p>
<p>Second team All-NBA<br />
G: Chris Paul<br />
G: Dwyane Wade<br />
F: Kevin Love<br />
F: Blake Griffin<br />
C: Andrew Bynum</p>
<p>Third team All-NBA<br />
G: Russell Westbrook<br />
G: Deron Williams<br />
F: LaMarcus Aldridge<br />
F: Dirk Nowitzki<br />
C: Roy Hibbert</p>
<p>Even with the injuries Rose is dealing with now, I can’t fathom the reigning MVP being off the first team since the Bulls will still be at or near the top of the standings at the end of the season. The other four first-team members are straightforward. Kobe will definitely be there since he’s averaging 29.0 points per game, a jump from the 25.3 he had the previous season. Durant will be on the first team since he is still one of the deadliest scorers in the game (through 32 games, he’s averaging the same 27.7 points per game but on a career-high 51.6 field goal percentage). LeBron is also a shoo-in since he’s playing possibly his best basketball of hi career. Dwight Howard will be there because … do you have any better ideas? In all seriousness, he has SEVEN 20-20 games halfway through the season. That’s impressive. Barring any unusual circumstances, I am confident that the first-team All-NBA will be exactly the same as the 2010-2011 first team.</p>
<p>As usual, it gets a little trickier with the second and third teams. Dwyane Wade is arguably a better player than Derrick Rose, but playing with LeBron and having injuries will probably relegate him to the second team with Chris Paul. Double-double machine Kevin Love, dunker Blake Griffin, and the surprisingly injured-free Andrew Bynum should compose the frontcourt of the second team.</p>
<p>This leaves Russell Westbrook as the easiest choice for the third-team. It’s a bit painful to do so – he’s averaging 23.4 points – but through 32 games, he’s also averaging a pitiful 5.5 assists per game, down from 8.2 the previous season. I think that fact, along with our tendency to view him as a ball-hogging shooting guard, will make voters put him on the third team along with Deron Williams. Dirk Nowitzki has picked it up after a slow start and will probably earn his way to the third team, although he’d probably get the respect of voters even if he averaged 18 points per game by the end of the season. First-time all-star LaMarcus Aldridge should get at least third team, and Roy Hibbert (another first-time all-star) will probably join him.</p>
<p>Here are my individual player awards:</p>
<p>MVP: LeBron James<br />
Finals MVP: LeBron James<br />
DPOY: Dwight Howard<br />
ROY: Kyrie Irving<br />
SMOY: James Harden<br />
MIP: Jeremy Lin<br />
COY: Doug Collins</p>
<p>I’m going to hold off on the playoff predictions for now. It’s too early to tell, and we could have a team rocket to a top seed by the end of the season (cough, cough … Knicks …). At this point, I’ll probably pick on a Heat-Thunder finals, with the Heat winning it all. It’s also worth noting that the Sixers’ recent slump near the all-star break and voter fatigue for Dwight Howard as DPOY could cause someone else to join the mix.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, here are my predicted all-defensive teams.</p>
<p>First team:<br />
1. Dwight Howard<br />
2. LeBron James<br />
3. Shawn Marion<br />
4. Andre Iguodala<br />
5. Serge Ibaka</p>
<p>Second team:<br />
1. Tony Allen<br />
2. Josh Smith<br />
3. Rajon Rondo<br />
4. Gerald Wallace<br />
5. Tyson Chandler</p>
