<p>One activity that I have been doing during my Christmas break from Berkeley is going over some old linear algebra lectures from MIT's OpenCourseWare (OCW). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05ABDDA6309CF78C">Here's the video playlist on YouTube</a> for Gilbert Strang's lectures; for some reason the videos on the actual MIT OCW website don't maximize correctly on my computer. As of this writing, I've gone through 13 out of the 35 videos, and I can probably watch the remaining videos in a week. The captioning quality is sufficient for me, though it's often behind or ahead by a few annoying seconds. Fortunately, Professor Strang has excellent articulation.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this? Because I really need to grill myself into understanding linear algebra inside out. It's one of those fields that I use all the time, but I never feel likeÂ I have a <em>deep, intuitive</em> understanding of it, at least to the extent possible when considering the limitations of the human mind. (It could be argued, however, that any mathematical subject feels that way to me.)</p>
<p>One of my courses last semester, the graduate-level Statistical Learning Theory (CS 281a) class, was heavily dependent on linear algebra. The professor would often write things in matrix or vector form on the board and either do some computations on them (e.g., using matrix calculus) or utilize some fact about them (e.g., that the reason why some proof works follows because our matrix is positive definite), and it would be up to the students to follow along.</p>
<p>For someone like me who probably gets less benefit from lecture than most other Berkeley students, I sometimes had difficulty following all the matrix operations. Also, I realized while taking this course that my knowledge of linear algebra wasn't as strong as it could be, <em>despite</em> my doing well in the corresponding course at Williams College <em>and </em>being a Teaching Assistant for it --- twice. Probably the most egregious gap in my linear algebra knowledge was that I had never seen the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix#Negative-definite.2C_semidefinite_and_indefinite_matrices"><em>positive definite</em></a> before Berkeley.</p>
<p>In contrast, I can see from the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/">video topics list</a> that lectures 25 and 27 go over positive definiteness. And there are several other important topics on the list that I don't think I experienced in my linear algebra class. The converse, however, isn't true: based on what I remember, my linear algebra class covered material that was a strict subset of the material in these video lectures, <em>with the exception of</em> how to write formal mathematics proofs. While the proofs part is important (and I'll get to this later), sometimes I worry that my math courses at Williams didn't sufficiently prepare me for graduate school, a feeling that I share with one other Williams math professor.</p>
<p>This raises the important questions: (1) what's the difference between linear algebra at MIT (I'm using the 18.06 version, not 18.700) versus Williams, (2) how do the role of <em>recitations</em> matter at MIT, and (3) should we spend time in linear algebra at Williams going over how to write proofs?</p>

<p><em><strong>Linear Algebra at MIT versus Williams</strong></em></p>
<p>First, let's start with the similarities regarding the linear algebra courses at MIT versus Williams. The <em>fundamental</em> concepts of linear algebra are covered:</p>
<ol>
<li>systems of equations, including elimination methods</li>
<li>vector spaces (e.g., column spaces, null spaces, etc.)</li>
<li>matrix properties (e.g., how to do operations, rank, etc.)</li>
<li>determinants</li>
<li>linear transformations, change of basis</li>
<li>eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalization</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of logistics, I think the number of lectures is the same: roughly thirty five 50-minute sessions, not including lectures where MIT may have had their hourly exams take place. At Williams, all my linear algebra exams occurred outside of lecture.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the differences. MIT's 18.06 course also covers these concepts that I don't think my class did:</p>
<ol>
<li>positive definiteness</li>
<li>singular value decompositions</li>
<li>left/right/pseudo inverses</li>
<li>Markov matrices, complex matrices, Fourier transformations</li>
<li>differential equations</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's <em>also</em> taking into account that the OCW website has <em>four</em> lectures dedicated to review! The reason for this discrepancy, I believe, is because in my linear algebra class,</p>
