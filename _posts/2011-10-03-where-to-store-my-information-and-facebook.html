<p>I've been thinking about where I should store the information I'm writing. I had a journal that I launched at the start of my freshman year at Williams College, and it's pretty lengthy - about 40 pages, single spaced in MicrosoftWord, covering over a year of information. However, lately, I've been slacking off on my online writing. (Maybe it's because I don't have any writing classes this semester?) Despite this, I am starting to develop alacrity for writing online, with some obvious reservations. Writing online seems to help me focus more on the content and style of my writing, which personal essays can't offer. And as I tell more and more people about this place -- I just told a frequent Facebook visitor that I launched this site -- I start to feel more and more motivated to write.</p>
<p>Speaking of Facebook ... I've definitely reduced my visits to that site. I was on there more than ten times a day during the summer, both out of pleasure and out of absolute necessity -- our Summer Academy group literally depended on Facebook to communicate with each other! But now that college has started, socialization is more oriented towards either texting or direct, face-to-face communication. Consequently ... my Facebook's been dead for over a month. :( Considering that I average about 2 notifications a day now, I don't think its worth the hassle to keep updating my page. I'll just leave it alone for now, and at the same time feel sorry for those people who have their schoolwork affected by Facebook obsession. This reminds me of a striking blog entry by Georgetown assistant professor of computer science Calvin Newport called <a title="An" href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/29/an-argument-for-quitting-facebook/">An Argument for Quitting Facebook</a>. I do find it creepy that he used my name for the post. I hope that one day I can give out advice as splendid as Newport.</p>
<p>It's good to get some thoughts out in writing after 9 hours of working today ... I have a Discrete Mathematics test Wednesday and a Microeconomic Theory test Thursday. As a bonus question in math, I have to prove something quite eccentric called the Four-Color Theorem in my own words. If I can do that, I can get an immediate 100 on the test. (Wait ... the Four-Color Theorem reminds me that this place needs pictures ... more on that later.) But then again, I think I'm capable of acing these two tests, given that there isn't likely to be a strong curve. "<em>Aim for an A+.</em>"</p>
