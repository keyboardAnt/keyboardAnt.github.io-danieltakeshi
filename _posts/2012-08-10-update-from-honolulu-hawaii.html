<p>As I mentioned earlier, I'm in Honolulu, Hawaii. I've been taking many pictures, which gives me the chance to <em>finally</em> add a picturesque post to my text-based blog. And since I just turned 20, I can continue to post on my birthday, just as I <a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/so-i-turned-19/">did last year</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting Kauai, the fourth Hawaiian island I've set foot on. I took a picture of the same falls that was on the cover page of the tour guide. It's gorgeous.</p>

<p>Here's a view of Waimea Canyon, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea_Canyon_State_Park">Grand Canyon of the Pacific</a>. I've never been to the real Grand Canyon, but it felt like I was looking at a similar structure of nature. The view was so nice that I decided to add a panorama of this to replace the ugly default image of this WordPress Blog template.</p>
<p><a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/update-from-honolulu-hawaii/2012-08-04-13-49-27/" rel="attachment wp-att-501"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-501" title="2012-08-04 13.49.27" alt="" src="assets/2012-08-04-13-49-27.jpg?w=460" width="460" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>Back in Oahu, I was at Waimea <em>Bay</em>. (What's up with the repeated name?) This is one of the most beautiful beaches I've set foot on. I'm glad this is the summer -- I've heard that real waves appear in the winter.</p>
<p><a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/update-from-honolulu-hawaii/2012-08-09-13-06-46/" rel="attachment wp-att-512"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-512" title="2012-08-09 13.06.46" alt="" src="assets/2012-08-09-13-06-46.jpg?w=460" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>There were also some nice Japanese-style temples on the way back from Waimea.</p>
<p><a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/update-from-honolulu-hawaii/2012-08-09-16-46-37/" rel="attachment wp-att-516"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-516" title="2012-08-09 16.46.37" alt="" src="assets/2012-08-09-16-46-37.jpg?w=460" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards, I made my way to the famous Nuuanu Pali Lookout, whose strong winds are (sadly) the only thing that can make my hair stick up. Looking at this reminded me that I should have increased the resolution of my images on my phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/update-from-honolulu-hawaii/2012-08-09-18-09-31/" rel="attachment wp-att-517"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-517" title="2012-08-09 18.09.31" alt="" src="assets/2012-08-09-18-09-31.jpg?w=460" width="460" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, I've also had my share of mischievous moments.</p>
<p><a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/update-from-honolulu-hawaii/photo/" rel="attachment wp-att-499"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-499" title="photo" alt="" src="assets/photo1.jpg?w=460" width="460" height="613" /></a></p>
<p>All right, that's enough for now. It's back to more traditional blog entries later. I have a lot I want to talk about in the next month.</p>
