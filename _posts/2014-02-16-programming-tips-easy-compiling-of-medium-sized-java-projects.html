<p>I've recently been working with a piece of code that consists of roughly a hundred total Java programs. Fortunately, the original creator of the code bundled it up into packages and made a separate file for all the byte code. I'd like to explain how a typical, small-to-medium size code set is organized. The material in this article should be mostly review for those who have experience programming Java projects.</p>
<p>First, in Java, we have the .java files and the .class files. The file system I have is such that files are split into .java files (i.e., a "source" or "src" directory) and bytecode files, i.e., .class files (i.e., a "binary" or "bin" folder). By the way, that "bin" command seems to be fairly standard ... [Check that ... and also explain that java code gets compiled into bytecode]</p>
<p>Then talk briefly about how to compile the code, i.e., using javac. What does that do?</p>
<p>But there's a problem if you try to use javac on one piece of code in a project, because in all likelihood, there will be dependencies, which means one cannot simply compile one piece of code. You have to compile everything.</p>
<p>Fortunately, javac supports multiple compilations:</p>
<p>javac code1 code2 ... coden (and you can also compile all java source code files in some directory by using the /directory/*.java/Â  command)</p>
<p>But another problem is that the default directory where the binary files are located is going to be messed up. We want to preserve the structure of the source code directory. The solution is to just use -bin.</p>
<p>Now, typing all that seems like a pain. Fortunately, Makefiles come to the rescue! Now, we just have to type in 'make' and that will compile everything for us! (Use 'man make' for more information.)</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are alternatives such as Ant or Maven. But for a small project, you really don't need to do anything beyond a simple makefile. I can compile everything in my project in two seconds, so there is little advantage for me to go out of my way to optimize the compilation step.</p>
