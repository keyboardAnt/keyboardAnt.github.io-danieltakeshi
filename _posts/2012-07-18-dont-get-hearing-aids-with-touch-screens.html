<p>A few months ago, I made a Facebook status update announcing how happy I was to have new hearing aids. Well, I'm still glad to have them, but I have one main gripe about their touch screen. The <em>slightest drop of sweat</em> that contacts the touch screen will cause the hearing aid to act unpredictably.</p>
<p>My hearing aid model can be found <a href="http://www.starkeypro.com/public/professionals/products/hearing-aids/x-series/power-bte.jsp">here</a>. And as you can guess, instead of having the old-fashioned hearing aid switch that you click to increase the volume control, there's a touch screen instead. Pushing your fingertips up the back of the hearing aid will increase volume; pushing it down will decrease volume. And touching the hearing aid will change the mode (e.g. the T-coil, or telecoil).</p>
<p>Actually, that's almost as annoying to me as my main gripe, which I mentioned earlier. Suppose I have an itch near the back of my ear. If I inadvertently touch the back of the hearing aid while trying to relieve myself, I'll change the mode when I don't want to. This forces me to make a few more touches in order to get it back to the old mode. And switching modes causes a temporary blockage of sound from entering my ear.</p>
<p>But to me, the bigger problem is that if I engage in any sort of physical activity for just a few minutes, the sweat that gets in touch with the hearing aid will cause it to behave abnormally. When my hearing aids first acted weirdly by making a lot of beep-beep-beep sounds due to sweat, I thought they were breaking down. But then I realized that the sweat was causing the hearing aid mode to change! The sweat seemingly perturbs the touch screen and causes it to touch itself. So I end up tapping the hearing aid a few more times to get it back to the right mode. But then it changes modes again! And again! The cycle continues. </p>
<p>So, for instance, when I go to the weight room, I make sure I have my backup hearing aids on, which do not have a touch screen. Alternatively, I'll just take off the hearing aids. (This presents a multitude of additional risks, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're not experienced with lifting weights, or if the gym is especially crowded.)</p>
<p>I've learned my lesson. I'm still happy to wear these hearing aids, but when I get new pairs in a few years, I'll be sure to avoid the ones with touch screens.</p>
