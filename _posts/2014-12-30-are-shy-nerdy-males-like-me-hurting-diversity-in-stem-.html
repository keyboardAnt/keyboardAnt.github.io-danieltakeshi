<p>Outline: (yeah this will be a long post ... hope readers will read it!) But somehow make it clear that I have some kind of potential hypothesis on what's going on?</p>
<p>TODO Reword this so that I have some clear argument that I can take a stance on. The question, of course, is how many.</p>
<p>(1) Intro, brief statistics on diversity (perhaps also take from the Berkeley town hall?)</p>
<p>(2) Discuss why I want to do this</p>
<p>(3) Discuss first my belief on Walter Lewin but say I won't delve further into that</p>
<p>--read more link--</p>
<p>(4) Post a copy of my entire comment)</p>
<p>(5) Now talk about my own experience ... what can I do to help out? Given that the number of females (aside from family) that I can probably talk to this is about zero?</p>
<p>(6) Post a FIRM opinion. I need to get that somewhere. I DON'T think we're the problem, of course. Just say I'm siding with Scott Aaronson here. I think there are other issues:</p>
<p>(a) discuss issue 1</p>
<p>(b) discuss issue 2</p>
<p>(7) Discuss how he's sort of like my ideal and I agree with him on other things (e.g., scientific talks are also a waste of time).</p>
<p>After a string of several non-controversial posts here, I feel like it's time to start discussing more sensitive issues. (Hey, the famous economist Paul Krugman famously said that if an author doesn't say anything controversial, it is a waste of space.) The issue will be about diversity in STEM with respect to race and gender, which are the two most common metrics departments use nowadays. It's well-known that STEM has a diversity problem, and computer science even more so than most. (Links needed)</p>
<p>I'm prompted by a series of posts by Scott Aaronson on this issue, who is currently a tenured computer science professor at MIT. He also has a blog, which is far more popular for me (seriously, I don't know what he did to get popular) and in a series of recent posts, he discusses his story about growing up as a shy, nerdy child in STEM.</p>
<p>The story starts out of his <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2091">December 10 post on Walter Lewin</a>, a famous MIT professor who was stripped of his emeritus title due to sexual harassment. As a result, his well-known videos on physics lectures have been taken down. I disagree with this decision, but I don't feel strongly about it.</p>
<p>But the discussion then started about the problems with STEM. Specifically, with (usually white) nerdy males.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Scott wrote a touching comment (<a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2091#comment-326664">comment 171</a>) that resulted in a storm of criticism, prompting him to write a <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2119">follow-up post</a>. These are really personal, and while it does help to have tenure already despite being so young (Scott apparently skipped a few grades in school ... I wish I could have done that), it's very unexpected to see something like this happen.</p>
<p>Here is the comment I wrote to his follow up post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you very much, Scott, for this post and comment 171. I would view myself as one of those shy nerdy males in STEM and could relate to what you said, and I guess I’ll post my real name as well. I’ve always had trouble figuring out social cues and trying to make friends, and to add on to the difficulty, I’m also deaf, so even trivial conversations can be a lot of trouble for me.</p>
<p>Seeing all the news regarding sexual assault and biases against women, which I know exist (I’m not here to deny that!) but seem so foreign to me, has made me wonder how an awkward STEM male like me can help out. Is there some common advice for that? I mention “foreign” because I’m <i>almost positive</i> that I have never been a perpetrator of sexual assault or substantial bullying, not because I think I have impeccable decorum, but because I don’t have many social contexts to remember that might have led to those outcomes.</p>
<p>If anything, I feel like seeing the issues that women face, whether it’s from public news (e.g., Walter Lewin) or from women themselves (e.g., the blogs Female Science Professor, Women in Philosophy, etc.) has made me <i>more</i> socially awkward. Right now, whenever I talk to women, I make sure to give them lots of space, think thrice before saying any sort of joke, and I have little interest in acts such as shaking hands, unless it’s <i>very, very clear</i> that they are the initiators. The situation for me is less extreme when I’m talking to men, though I still engage in far less “touching” behavior than most men I see.</p>
<p>Reading this conversation here, I’m reminded by Hillary Clinton’s recent discussion regarding the Eric Garner and Mike Brown killings, when she said “imagine what it’s like to be a young black man.” Every time I read stories about someone’s troubles (e.g., like in comment 171) I try to constantly remind myself about trying to imagine what it’s like to be in that person’s situation. Do I think you may have <i>slightly</i> exaggerated your story? Yes. But do I also think you went through a lot of trouble and don’t deserve to be blindly given the label “hey, elite white male!!!”? <i>Absolutely!</i></p>
<p>Similarly, I often think about what it would be like for me to be a woman in STEM. Likewise, I hope that more people will try to take the time to think about what it’s like to be us. Of course, the problem is that thinking about what it’s like to be another person is very difficult: everyone’s different, and I worry that a lot of people would just laugh at our painful stories despite how difficult it is for me (and must have been for you). I’ve felt left out of social groups from elementary school through college, <i>including</i> groups that involve other nerdy STEM males. I’ve had constant reminders from others that I need to be more social (naturally, without any specific advice), and I sometimes wish I could just tell those people that it’s a little hard for me to even communicate with others.</p>
<p>In the best case scenario, my life will be able to mirror yours in that the confidence gained from scientific research will translate into increased expertise in social skills (unfortunately, I’m nowhere near that point in life). I wonder if your years at Berkeley allowed you to abandon the experiences you describe in comment 171. That I enjoyed computer science and mathematics allowed me to go through the grind of college and mask my social issues, and now that I’m a PhD student at Berkeley, I do feel like I’m on the right track.</p></blockquote>
<p>So yeah, maybe this was also an unusually personal comment, and I put my full name up there so it's not exactly a secret. I'm happy he wrote about this, in part because he has the kind of life that I'd love to have, because I've also went through his problems, though I also had extra problems.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
