<p>Java was the first programming language I felt comfortable enough to write lengthy programs that, for instance, could be used to advance the goals of a research project. So for my first program needed for my <a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/wrapping-up-my-summer-research/">summer research</a> at the <a href="http://seitad.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/summer-at-bard/">Bard College REU</a>, I used Java. I wrote code to create a random sentence generator. That was during my second week of the REU, and I had writen <em>one</em> significant Python script in my life, which was for a bonus question from my Algorithm Design &amp; Analysis homework.</p>
<p>Let's fast forward a bit. By the time the REU ended, I had written over 20 significant programs ... in <em>Python</em>. So what happened?</p>
<p>At the start of the REU, I knew much more about Java than Python. But after some prodding by my advisors, and the fact that everyone else in my research project was using Python, I switched languages. I soon found -- as they said I would -- that Python was so much easier to write than Java. In particular, the file input and output is so stunningly simple, yet incredibly useful, a must for all the scripts we wrote that involved manipulating files. My project, after all, was about text simplification, and all the relevant corpora were stored in files. </p>
<p>I also found it easier to understand the official <a href="http://docs.python.org/">Python documentation</a> than <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/">Java's</a>, so looking up things was less of a challenge. Like the guy who wrote this (heavily biased) article about <a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/python-java-a-side-by-side-comparison/">Python versus Java</a>, I have to look up a lot of things for Java, whereas the same became a bit less true for Python.</p>
<p>My experience confirmed what I've heard that learning new languages is easier once one becomes proficient at another language. Well, with the possible exception of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge">Malbolge</a>.</p>
