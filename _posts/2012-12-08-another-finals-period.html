<p>I've got another finals period coming up. It concludes on December 17th, so I'll update after that point. (And modify this post.)</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
<p>UPDATE 12/23/12.</p>
<p>All right, I'm back home and settled for the holidays. This past semester went relatively well; I only took classes in my two majors, and I achieved my goal of a 4.0 GPA and have set up a new research project for this winter. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do as much theoretical computer science review on this blog as I wanted, so I'll continue that in the beginning of 2013. Related to that, here are some of the possible topics I'll write about this winter and the spring:</p>
<p>1. Deaf friendly tactics</p>
<p>2. Computer science research topics</p>
<p>3. More posts that weave deafness and computer science together, such as deaf computer scientists or new machine learning technology (hey, my current area of research!)</p>
<p>4. How to ace the GRE</p>
<p>5. Anything else I can think of ...</p>
