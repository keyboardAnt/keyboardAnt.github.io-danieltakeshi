<p>Last night, I participated in a popular American tradition by watching the Super Bowl game. You can read recaps on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/sports/football/peyton-manning-goes-cold-as-seattle-brings-the-heat.html?hp">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=340202007">ESPN</a>, and other sources.</p>
<p>The game itself ended up being a blowout. It was boring to someone like me who doesn't actively support either the Denver Broncos or the Seattle Seahawks. I also don't watch halftime shows, so that didn't increase my excitement of the game.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">The commercials were also a bit of a disappointment, at least compared to the ones in last year's Super Bowl. But one of them did catch my eye. No, it was not a Tim Tebow commercial, even though he was arguably the more impressive Denver Broncos-affiliated quarterback last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">It was </span>the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2HD57z4F8E">Duracell batteries commercial</a>, featuring the deaf Seattle Seahawks player Derrick Coleman. In just a single minute, it chronicles his story from a young boy into a current NFL player. It also seems to have inspired <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/derrick-coleman-invites-deaf-girls-super-bowl-article-1.1596763">two other deaf girls to write letters of support to Coleman</a>. Imagine their surprise when Coleman met them and offered tickets to the Super Bowl!</p>
<p>Now, I know a lot of deaf people. I actually went on Facebook (!) last night, and saw deaf people supporting the Seattle Seahawks <em>just because</em> Coleman was on the team. So his story is inspiring, and clearly has an effect on other deaf people. It will be interesting to see how his career progresses --- he's only 23, by the way --- and if other deaf players will join him in the NFL.</p>
