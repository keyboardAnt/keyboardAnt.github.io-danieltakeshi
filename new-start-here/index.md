I will list some of my recommended posts on this page. Due to (as of May 14, 2015) the migration
of this blog from Wordpress to Jekyll, I will need to fix up some of the links here and modify some
old entries. Once I've done that, I'll update this page with some of my favorite or best entries.

In the meantime, here's a little bit of information that I put in a sidebar, that will do for now:

*This is my blog, where I have written over 150 articles on a variety of topics, most of which are
about one of two major themes. The first is computer science, which is my area of speciality as a
Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. The second can be broadly categorized as "deafness," which relates to
my experience and knowledge of being deaf.*
