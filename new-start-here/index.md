[In progress] I'm going to list some of my favorite blog posts here. Someday.

In the meantime, here's a little bit of information that I put in a sidebar, that will do for now:

*This is my blog, where I have written over 200 articles on a variety of topics, most of which are
about one of two major themes. The first is computer science, which is my area of speciality as a
Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. The second can be broadly categorized as "deafness," which relates to
my experience and knowledge of being deaf.*

If you find this website useful, please do let me know about it, and also encourage me to fix up
this page.
