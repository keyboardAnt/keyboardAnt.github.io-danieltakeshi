You can see the one-paragraph description of the blog in the footers, repeated here for convenience:

*This is my blog, where I have written over 225 articles on a variety of topics, most of which are
about one of two major themes. The first is computer science, which is my area of specialty as a
Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. The second can be broadly categorized as "deafness," which relates to
my experience and knowledge of being deaf.*

The easiest way to find something that you'll be interested in is to [look at the archives][10] and
browse the titles, which (I hope) are descriptive. Using the built-in Google site search there would
also be prudent.

If you're interested in knowing more about the classes at Berkeley, I write reviews on all the ones
I have taken. Here are a few examples:

- [CS 287, Advanced Robotics][1]
- [CS 294-112, Deep Reinforcement Learning][2]
- [EE 227BT, Convex Optimization][3]
- [EE 227C, Convex Optimization and Approximation][4]

When I was preparing for the AI prelims at Berkeley, I wrote a lot about AI topics. I also wrote a
"transcript" of my prelims.

- [Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning][5]
- [Perceptrons, SVMs, and Kernel Methods][6]
- [Notes on Exact Inference in Graphical Models][7]
- [The Least Mean Squares Algorithm][8]
- [My Prelims][9] *[Transcript]*

I also write a lot about other technical areas, and am attempting to write up more about my thoughts
on various technical research papers. I also have reviews of non-technical books here. Here are a
few:

- [Some Recent Results on Minibatch Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods][25]
- [My Three Favorite Books I Read in 2015][20] *[Non-Technical]*
- [Independent Component Analysis --- A Gentle Introduction][17]
- [Ten Things Python Programmers Should Know][14]

If you are interested in knowing about what it's like being deaf, then there are a *lot* of options.
Here are a few that might be informative:

- [The Obligatory "Can I Lip Read?" Question][19]
- [Advocate for Yourself][13]
- [After a Few Weeks of CART, Why do I Feel Dissatisfied?][16]
- [The Problem with Seminars][15]
- [My Pre-College Education as a Deaf Mainstreamed Student][22]
- [New Closed-Captioning Glasses][23]
- [Hearing Aids: How They Help and How They Fall Short in Group Situations][11]
- [Technical Term Dilemma][21]

Finally, here are a few random posts that I thought were interesting.

- [The BVLC (BAIR) Retreat: Disaster Averted!][18]
- [Why Computer Science is a Good Major for Deaf Students][12]
- [It's Time to Ditch PowerPoint and Word in Favor of LaTeX][24]
